# Single-Page CV
Hello!
Here is the project URL:https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
Copy paste the code in your notepad and save it to your folder(don't forget to add .html or .htm) then open it will display the results in your browser. 
This is the easiest way out here to run a html code (as far as I know, since im a beginner)
or maybe try out some online complier which is present in the online you can just go type "html online complier" and you'll see a lot of options.
.
Since I only know html i just did the basic stuff. i'll try improving this later on (hopefully).
